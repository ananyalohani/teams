## Agile Techniques Used

#### Kanban Board

I used a [Kanban board](<(https://github.com/users/ananyalohani/projects/2)>) to organise my tasks by dividing them into 4 categories: **To do**, **In Progress**, **Done** and **Bugs**. I also set an In progress limit of 3, meaning if the In Progress column had 3 tasks, I had to finish them before I move on to start new tasks.

The development of this project was iterative: Design, Code, Redesign, Fix Bugs. I preferred a Kanban board over a Scrum board since I was working a little on each phase throughout the four weeks, and I didnâ€™t see fit to add start and end dates on the sprints.

## API Reference

The network quality of participants in a call can be analysed using Twilio's Network Quality API.

#### Get network quality info for users in a room

```http
GET /api/network-quality?roomId=${roomId}
```

| Parameter | Type     | Description                                                |

| `roomId`  | `string` | **Required**. RoomId for which you want to see the details |

## Development
