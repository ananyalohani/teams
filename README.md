## Agile Techniques Used

#### Kanban Board

I organised my tasks by dividing them into 4 categories: **To do**, **In Progress**, **Done** and **Bugs**. I also set an In progress limit of 3, meaning if the In Progress column had 3 tasks, I had to finish them before I move on to start new tasks.

I preferred a Kanban board over a Scrum board since I was working a little on each phase throughout the four weeks, and I didnâ€™t see fit to add start and end dates on the sprints.

Find the Kanban board [here](https://github.com/users/ananyalohani/projects/2).
